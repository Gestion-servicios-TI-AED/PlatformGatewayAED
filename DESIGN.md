# Design System: HRMS aed

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Precise Ledger"**

HRMS aed is where a construction company keeps the truth about its people — contracts,
salaries, seguridad social, medical restrictions, disciplinary history. The system behaves
like a well-kept ledger, not a marketing surface: every screen is built to be scanned fast,
trusted completely, and never ambiguous. aed's own brand identity is bold, dynamic, and
vibrant (a signature green→blue gradient, electric blue, bright green) — this product wears
that identity as a **precise accent**, not as a wash across dense data screens. Color earns
its place; most of the interface is calm, cool-tinted neutral so that the two moments of real
color — a primary action, a status badge, the login/empty-state gradient — read as
deliberate, not decorative.

The product rejects two failure modes equally: the **outdated enterprise look** (dense gray
forms, unlabeled tables, generic icon sets — the SAP/Oracle-2000s trap) and the **generic
AI-SaaS look** (identical icon+text cards, gradient hero metrics, uppercase eyebrows on every
section, side-stripe accent borders). It is also not a consumer app — RR.HH. staff spend all
day here, and every employee will occasionally self-serve their own profile, so the interface
must flex between power-user density and lighter guided moments without changing its visual
language.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cool, blue-tinted neutral canvas — never the warm cream/sand "AI default"
- aed's Azul Vibrante and Verde Vibrante appear only as precise accents, never as large fills
- Employee profile is the hub: sections, not scattered top-level CRUD screens, are the primary
  navigational metaphor — horizontal underline tabs for short sets, a sticky vertical nav once
  a detail view grows past what a tab row can hold (see "Section Navigation" in §5 Components)
- Flat-by-default surfaces with tonal layering for hierarchy; shadows reserved for floating
  elements only
- Responsive motion (clear feedback on hover/focus/load) without choreography — confidence
  through clarity, not spectacle
- Every independently-scrolling pane eases its scroll delta (Lenis) so long pages read as one
  continuous surface instead of snapping section by section — see the Fluid Scroll Rule in
  §4 Elevation
- Record-editing views (the employee profile) open read-only; a single global Editar control
  gates the whole page into edit mode at once — see View/Edit Mode in §5 Components

## 2. Colors

A cool, brand-tinted neutral system carries almost the entire interface; aed's vibrant palette
is rationed to actions, status, and identity moments.

### Primary
- **Azul Vibrante** (#232BED): the one color that means "act here." Primary buttons, links,
  focus rings, the active tab indicator. Nothing else on a screen should compete with it for
  attention.

### Secondary
- **Verde Vibrante** (#23FF55): reserved for small, high-signal moments only — a status dot,
  a sliver of the aed gradient on the login screen or an empty state, never body text (fails
  contrast) and never a large fill. This is the one place a badge is allowed to use the raw
  vibrant token directly instead of its desaturated `-ink`/`-surface` pair: the 6px status dot
  inside an "Activo"/"Vigente" badge (see Status Dot in §5 Components) is small enough that it
  reads as an accent, not a fill, so it stays exempt from the Rationed Brand Rule's "no raw
  accent as fill" spirit while still counting toward the ≤10% budget.
- **Azul Profundo** (#0B2D4D): the "signature" deep blue from the brand manual. Used for the
  logo lockup area and the active/selected state of primary navigation — a small, fixed
  surface, not a full sidebar wash.

### Tertiary
- **Verde Profundo** (#014145): doubles as the accessible ink color for success states
  (approved, active, completed) — dark enough to pass text contrast, and it's an official aed
  color, so "success" reads as on-brand rather than borrowed from a generic green.

### Neutral
- **Bg** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 8%, white)`, ≈ #EDEEFE): the app canvas —
  a near-white with a *deliberately perceptible* cool tint toward aed's own blue hue, one step
  lighter than Surface. Deliberately not warm.
- **Surface** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 5%, white)`, ≈ #F4F4FE): panels, modals,
  table rows. Lighter than Bg on purpose — a card "pops" above the tinted canvas — but no longer
  a pure, isolated `#FFFFFF`: an earlier pass left Bg/Surface flat white while Sunken/Hover
  carried a strong tint, and the jump from "pure white card" straight to "clearly blue input"
  read as a hard edge rather than a gradient (see Named Rules below).
- **Surface Sunken** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 12%, white)`, ≈ #E5E6FD): the
  *resting* structural fill — table headers, zebra striping, form-input backgrounds
  (`Field.module.css` `.control`), stat chips, sunken cards/boxes.
- **Surface Hover** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 20%, white)`, ≈ #D3D5FB): the
  *interactive-feedback* fill — nav item hover/active, ghost/secondary button hover, dropdown
  item hover, table row hover. Noticeably more saturated than Surface Sunken on purpose, so a
  hover state reads as "this responds to you," distinct from a merely-structural sunken area.
  Never used for a resting/static background.
- **Surface Hover Strong** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 26%, white)`, ≈ #C6C8FA):
  one step past Surface Hover, used only for `.table tbody tr:nth-child(even):hover` — a row
  that was already zebra-striped (Surface Sunken at rest) darkens *further* on hover instead of
  resetting to the same Surface Hover a plain row would show.
- **Border** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 18%, white)`, ≈ #D7D9FC) / **Border
  Strong** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 30%, white)`, ≈ #BDBFFA): hairlines and
  dividers; Border Strong only for inputs and elements that need to read as
  interactive/editable.
- **Ink** (#10151F): primary text. **Ink Secondary** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-brand-deep)
  65%, #2B3341)`, ≈ #162F49): de-emphasized but still-dense text (secondary table columns,
  table header labels, nav item text) — derived from Azul Profundo rather than a flat gray.
  **Ink Muted** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-brand-deep) 58%, #545E70)`, ≈ #2A425C):
  captions, helper text, timestamps — darker than the neutral it replaced, so contrast only
  improved, still verified at ≥4.5:1 on both Bg and Surface; never a lighter "for elegance"
  gray.

### Named Rules
**The No-Cream Rule.** Off-white aed (#F0ECE6) is a warm print neutral from the brand manual —
right for business cards and letterhead, wrong for a screen. It never appears as the app
canvas. The product's neutrals are cool-tinted toward Azul Vibrante's own hue instead.

**The Brand-Tinted Neutral Rule** (2026-09-10, explicit user request on HRMS aed — "muy gris,"
an audit found 5 gray-family tokens repeated across ~30 CSS Modules). Every structural neutral
(Bg/Surface, Surface Sunken/Hover/Hover Strong, Border/Border Strong, Ink Secondary/Muted) is a
`color-mix()` of a real brand color (Azul Vibrante for fills/borders, Azul Profundo for text)
rather than a flat gray hex — same "cool, blue-tinted neutral" principle the system already
had, just executed at a tint strength that actually reads as brand-tinted instead of plain
gray. **Went through four calibrations the same day.** First attempt used 8–22% mixes —
visually indistinguishable from the flat gray it replaced, "only the hover states looked
different." Second attempt jumped to 18–38% on Sunken/Hover/Border but left **Bg and Surface
untouched at pure white** — now the opposite problem: inputs/tables read as sharply blue
against a page/card that was still stark white, "un contraste muy fuerte." Third pass gave
Bg/Surface a light tint too (4%/2%) and brought Sunken/Hover/Border down slightly (12–30%) —
but 4%/2% turned out to be the same "too-subtle-to-register" mistake as the very first attempt,
just applied to a different pair of tokens ("no noto ningún cambio" in the page background).
**Landed on a fourth pass**: Bg/Surface at 8%/5% — enough to actually read as tinted, not just
technically non-zero. The whole scale now moves together as one gradient (Surface → Bg →
Sunken → Hover → Hover Strong → Border → Border Strong, each a little more saturated than the
last) instead of an isolated blue block sitting on untouched white. This does **not** relax the
No-Cream Rule (still no warm Off-white as canvas) or the Rationed Brand Rule (these are
desaturated tints of a neutral surface, not the raw vibrant token used as a large solid fill —
the rule's own concern — so they don't count against the ≤10% budget) — no rule needed to be
removed, the early passes were simply calibrated too conservatively to register as a visible
change at all. Two deliberate exceptions stay flat gray, not brand-tinted: **Badge neutral variant** (a neutral badge exists specifically to say
"no special status" — tinting it blue would read as the existing Info badge) and **disabled
controls/icons** (`:disabled` text/backgrounds must read as "inert," not as a brand moment).

**The Rationed Brand Rule.** Azul Vibrante and Verde Vibrante combined should never cover more
than roughly 10% of any given screen's surface area. Their scarcity is what makes them read as
"act here" / "this succeeded" instead of decoration.

## 3. Typography

**Display/Headline/Title Font:** "TT Firs Neue" (aed's brand typeface; license/font files
pending — Inter is the interim stand-in, matching its grotesque character closely enough that
swapping the file later needs no layout changes).
**Body/Label Font:** Raleway (Google Fonts, freely available now).

**Character:** A confident, slightly bold grotesque for anything that orients the user
(page titles, tab labels, section headers) paired with a humanist, highly legible sans for the
actual work — long forms, dense tables, body copy. The pairing mirrors the brand manual's own
intent (TT Firs Neue for headlines, Raleway for body) exactly.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (600, clamp(1.5rem, 1.2rem + 1vw, 2rem), 1.2): large standalone numbers only
  (a KPI tile's big figure, e.g. `StatTile.jsx`'s `.statValue`) and a login screen's
  marketing-scale brand headline (its own clamp, only reuses the weight token). Not page
  titles (see Headline, below).
- **Headline** (600, 1.25rem, 1.3): page-level titles ("Perfil de Juan Pérez", "Empleados") AND
  section/tab-panel headers within a page (e.g. "Información Laboral") — same scale for both.
  Never a marketing-scale hero — this is a tool, not a landing page.
- **Title** (500, 1.0625rem, 1.4): card headers, modal titles, table section headers.
- **Body** (400, 1rem, 1.55): form field values, paragraph text, modal/dialog copy. Never
  smaller — WCAG floor for primary reading text. Max 75ch on any prose block (help text,
  descriptions).
- **Data** (400, 0.875rem, 1.4): dense table cells only — the "secondary UI, metadata" rung,
  distinct from Body. Never used for form inputs or anything the user reads at length.
- **Label** (600, 0.75rem, letter-spacing 0.03em, uppercase): table column headers and form
  field labels only — a functional micro-label, not a decorative section eyebrow.

### Named Rules
**The Tabular Numerals Rule.** Any column of numbers (salarios, días, cédulas, valores) uses
`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so digits align vertically. Non-negotiable for a payroll-
adjacent tool.

**Page title (`.title`): this CSS exact, not re-derived per project.** Incidente real
(2026-09-04): el HRMS aed tenía sus 12 títulos de página en la escala Display (`clamp(1.5rem,
1.2rem + 1vw, 2rem)`, hasta 32px) mientras que Contratación (ex-Solicitudes-Indirectos) ya usaba
Headline (1.25rem fijo, 20px) — el usuario prefirió el tamaño de Contratación y pidió
adoptarlo como la regla compartida. Cada página nueva usa este bloque completo para su `.title`
de nivel de página (`<h1>`), listo para copiar tal cual:

```css
.title {
  font-family: var(--font-display);
  font-size: var(--text-headline-size);
  font-weight: var(--text-headline-weight);
  margin: 0;
}
```

Sin `letter-spacing` ni `color` explícitos -- el `letter-spacing` de Display ya no aplica a esta
escala, y el color se hereda del `color` que `body` ya fija en `index.css` (ver la regla del
reset de `body`, más arriba en este documento) en vez de repetirse por página.

## 4. Elevation

Flat by default. Hierarchy between Bg → Surface → Surface Sunken is conveyed through the
neutral tonal ramp, not shadows — this keeps dense table/form screens calm. Shadows are used
sparingly and only for elements that are genuinely floating above the page flow.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Floating** (`box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(16, 21, 31, 0.12)`): dropdowns, popovers,
  date pickers.
- **Modal** (`box-shadow: 0 16px 48px rgba(16, 21, 31, 0.18)`): dialogs, the multi-step
  employee creation wizard.
- **Toast** (`box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(16, 21, 31, 0.15)`): transient notifications.

### Named Rules
**The Floating-Only Rule.** If it doesn't detach from the page's normal flow (a card, a table
row, a form section), it doesn't get a shadow. Depth is earned by z-index, not applied by
default.

### Motion & Scroll

Two speeds cover the whole product: `duration-fast` (120ms) for hover/focus/active-state
feedback on small elements (buttons, nav items, inputs), `duration-standard` (200ms) for
larger surface changes (modals, tab-panel swaps). Both always pair with `ease-standard`
(`cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`, an ease-out-quart) — decisive on the way in, no bounce, no
elastic. Every transition declares both properties explicitly (`transition: background-color
120ms ease-standard, color 120ms ease-standard`); never a bare `transition: all`.

**The Fluid Scroll Rule.** Every independently-scrolling content pane (the main content area,
never the sidebar nav) is wrapped in Lenis (`lenis/react`'s `<ReactLenis root={false}>`) so
wheel/touch input eases into a continuous glide instead of the browser's default step-per-tick
feel — the thing that reads as a page scrolling "by section" rather than smoothly. `root={false}`
scopes Lenis to that one container: it still uses native `scrollTop`/`overflow-y: auto`
under the hood (not a transform-based virtual scroll), so `position: sticky` children — like
the profile's vertical section nav — keep working exactly as they would unsmoothed. Lenis
respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by default; never override that. The sidebar nav and any
`position: fixed` chrome are left outside the Lenis wrapper and keep native instant scroll.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** 6px radius (`{rounded.sm}`) — precise, not soft, not sharp.
- **Primary:** Azul Vibrante fill, white text, 10px/20px padding. One primary action per view.
- **Hover / Focus:** primary darkens to #1B21C4 on hover; focus-visible gets a 2px Azul
  Vibrante ring offset 2px from the element, never a color-only change (keyboard users need
  the ring).
- **Secondary:** white surface, Ink text, Border-strong 1px outline. **Ghost:** no fill/border,
  Ink-secondary text, used for low-emphasis row actions (edit/delete icons in tables).

### Badges / Status Pills
- **Style:** full pill radius, semantic surface + ink pair (success/warning/danger/info from
  the token set), label typography. Used for `estado` (Activo/Inactivo/Vacaciones/...),
  contract status, incapacidad/permiso approval state.
- **Rule:** background is always the desaturated `-surface` token, never the `-ink` token as a
  fill with white text — keeps status color reserved for meaning, not decoration.
- **Status Dot:** for the one or two states that mean "this is the live, positive one" (an
  employee's `estado = ACTIVO`, a contract's `estado = Vigente`), the badge gets an optional
  leading 6px `border-radius: 50%` dot filled with the raw `accent-vibrant` (Verde Vibrante)
  token — not `success-ink`. It's the single spot in the product where the literal brand green
  shows up as a fill; keep it capped at that 6px dot, never grow it into a stripe or a larger
  chip.

### Tables
- **Style:** Surface background, Surface Sunken zebra striping on alternate rows, Border
  hairlines between rows only (no vertical column rules — reduces visual noise in wide
  employee tables). Header row uses Label typography on Surface Sunken; cells use Data
  typography (0.875rem) — never Body size, this is the one place text legitimately drops
  below 1rem, per the "secondary UI, metadata" rung of the type scale.
- **Row hover, two levels, not one.** A plain row hovers to Surface Hover; a row that's
  already zebra-striped (Surface Sunken at rest) hovers to the darker **Surface Hover Strong**
  instead (`.table tbody tr:nth-child(even):hover`, more specific than the plain
  `tr:hover` rule so it wins). Using the same Surface Hover for every row regardless of its
  resting shade made a zebra row look like it "reset" to a lighter tone on hover instead of
  darkening further — found as a real bug 2026-09-10 once the neutral tokens got bold enough
  for the flattening to be visible.
- **Density:** compact by default (row height ~40px) for RR.HH. list views; never nested
  cards inside a table cell.
- **Width:** list/table views always use the full content width of the page — the data is the
  point, so it gets the space; constrain width only for genuinely narrow content (a login
  form, a confirmation dialog), never for a data table.

### Row Icon Actions (mandatory on every table/list row — never text buttons)
Every row's Editar and Activar/Inactivar actions render as **icon buttons**
(`EditIconButton`/`ToggleActivoIconButton`, `components/ui/RowIconButtons.jsx`), never as text
buttons reading "Editar"/"Inactivar"/"Activar" — a pencil icon for Editar, a circle-with-line
(inactivar, turns danger-red on hover) or circle-with-cross (activar) for the toggle, both
32×32px in a right-aligned flex `.actionsCell`. One shared component, not copy-pasted SVG per
table — the gap this closes: a table that already had icons would hand-duplicate the same SVG
markup instead of importing a shared one, and a table built later would default back to plain
text buttons because nothing forced the icon convention. A **page-level** edit-mode toggle (the
big "Editar"/"Guardar"/"Cancelar" button pair at the top of a detail page) is a different pattern
(see View/Edit Mode below) and stays text — this rule is only for per-row actions inside a table
or list.

```jsx
<div className={styles.actionsCell}>
  <EditIconButton label={`Editar ${item.nombre}`} onClick={() => startEdit(item)} />
  <ToggleActivoIconButton
    activo={item.activo}
    labelActivar={`Activar ${item.nombre}`}
    labelInactivar={`Inactivar ${item.nombre}`}
    onClick={() => toggleActivo(item)}
  />
</div>
```

### Pagination (mandatory on every server-paginated list)

**Rule:** every server-paginated table uses `Pagination.jsx` (`components/ui/`) — same footer
bar, same two buttons, same wording in every project. Never a hand-rolled pager, never numbered
page buttons with ellipsis truncation. The component self-hides when there's nothing to paginate
(`total === 0` or a single page) — callers never need to remember that guard.

```jsx
<Pagination page={meta.page} pageSize={meta.pageSize} total={meta.total} onPageChange={setPage} />
```

| Element | Property | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Footer bar | layout | `justify-content: space-between`, `1px solid --color-border` top border, `--color-surface` background |
| Footer bar | padding | `8px` (`--space-sm`) top/bottom, `16px` (`--space-md`) left/right |
| Count text (`Mostrando X–Y de Z`) | type | `--text-data-size`, `--color-ink-muted` |
| Buttons | style | `Button variant="secondary"`, labels `‹ Anterior` / `Siguiente ›` — never bare glyphs alone, never "Prev/Next" |
| Page indicator (`Página X de Y`) | type | same as count text, sits between the two buttons |

### Fluid Width Rule (every view adapts to the viewport — no fixed widths)

**Rule:** no page, card, or section gets a hardcoded `max-width` that caps it below the available
viewport — a view must adapt to however wide the screen actually is, never assume a fixed width
and let content wrap/cut off around that assumption. This applies everywhere, not just the Tables
width guidance above.

The only legitimate `max-width` values are on content that's narrow **by nature**, not by
assumption about screen size: a search box, a filter dropdown, a tooltip bubble, the login
split-screen's text column, a single prose paragraph capped at 75ch for readability. If a
`max-width` is being added to a `.page`, `.card`, or any container that wraps a table or a `.row`
of form fields, that's the tell this rule is about to be violated — don't.

Content that's genuinely wider than any viewport (a table with many columns) scrolls
horizontally **inside its own container** (`overflow-x: auto` on the table wrapper) — it never
gets silently clipped, and it never forces the whole page to scroll sideways.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** Surface Sunken background at rest, 1px Border, 6px radius.
- **Focus:** border shifts to Azul Vibrante + subtle 2px outer ring, no glow/blur effect.
- **Error:** border and helper text switch to `danger-ink`; the error message replaces the
  helper text, it never stacks below it.
- **Disabled:** Surface Sunken background, Ink-muted text, no border.

### Selección de uno a muchos (mandatory whenever a field assigns many items)

**Rule:** any field that assigns multiple items — a role's permission matrix, a multi-role
picker, users assigned to a record, approvers for a workflow step — uses one of two components,
never a bare `<select multiple>` (the native listbox's "Ctrl/Cmd+click to pick several" is not
discoverable, has no search, and gives no compact view of what's currently selected) and never a
long run-on paragraph of unstyled checkboxes wrapping by screen width (illegible past 4–5
options, no visual hierarchy).

- **`CheckboxGroup.jsx`** (`components/ui/`, pairs with `Checkbox.jsx`) — for a **short, fixed**
  set of independent boolean choices known ahead of time (a role's permission flags, a multi-role
  selector with a handful of roles). Renders as a `Surface Sunken` grid
  (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(220px, 1fr))`, never a single wrapping row),
  optionally with a `selectAllLabel` toggle for longer fixed lists. No search — search is
  friction a 5–15 item fixed list doesn't need.
- **`CheckboxListSelect.jsx`** (`components/ui/`) — for a **long and/or growing** list where
  search matters (assigning employees/users to a record, picking approvers from the whole
  company) and/or the options need grouping. Selected items render as removable pill chips above
  a bordered panel containing a search input, a live count, a "Limpiar" action, and the
  (optionally grouped) checkbox list itself (`max-height: 280px`, own scroll).

**Deciding which one:** if the option count is small and won't grow (a fixed enum of roles or
permissions), `CheckboxGroup`. If it's "pick from a list that could have dozens of rows and keeps
growing" (people, records), `CheckboxListSelect`. Never reach for a bare `<select multiple>` for
either case.

### Forms
- **Full-Width Rule:** forms take the full content width, not a narrow constrained centered
  column. Fields are organized into horizontal rows (`fieldSm`/`fieldMd`/`fieldLg` width
  classes inside a wrapping flex `.row`) so related fields sit side by side — a form is read
  left-to-right within a row, then top-to-bottom across rows, not as one long vertical stack.
- **Sectioned Rule:** related fields are grouped under a named section — a heading (Title
  typography) plus an optional one-line hint (Ink-muted, Data typography) — instead of one
  undifferentiated field list. Every multi-field form in the product uses this grouping so
  long forms stay scannable.
- **View/Edit Mode:** record-editing views render fields read-only by default. A single global
  **Editar** button — top-right of the page header, in line with the page title, outside the
  content card — switches the whole page into edit mode at once (swapping to **Cancelar** /
  **Guardar**). It is never repeated per section: implemented by wrapping each section's
  fields in a `<fieldset disabled>` driven by one shared boolean owned by the page layout, not
  by each section independently. Guardar submits via the native `form="…"` attribute pointing
  at whichever section's `<form>` is currently visible, so the header button never needs to
  reach into child state directly. Cancelar restores the last saved values. This mode only
  applies to editing an existing record; a linear creation wizard has no read-only state —
  fields are always editable there, since there's nothing saved yet to protect against
  accidental edits.

### Section Navigation (signature component — the record-detail hub)
Two variants of the same idea — "which slice of this record am I looking at" — chosen by how
many sections there are, not by developer preference:
- **Underline tabs (≤~8 sections):** horizontal row, Ink-secondary text at rest, Ink + 2px Azul
  Vibrante underline when active. Scrollable horizontally with a fade edge if it ever
  overflows; never wrapped to a second row.
- **Vertical section nav (>~8 sections):** a fixed-width (224px) sticky column to the left of
  the content card, one item per line, Surface Sunken background + Azul Vibrante text on the
  active item. Once a detail view crosses into the double digits, even a flat single list
  stops being scannable — group the sections into a small number of named, collapsible themes
  (an accordion, not N independent disclosures): only the group containing the active section
  is open, opening a different group's header closes whichever was open (never more than one
  expanded at once, and switching sections within the same group leaves it open rather than
  re-collapsing). The group header is a small-caps label (Label typography) with a trailing
  chevron that rotates 90° open, `duration-standard` + `ease-standard`, guarded under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. A single scannable vertical list, sticky so it stays put while the
  content pane scrolls (compatible with the Fluid Scroll Rule in §4 — Lenis wraps the content
  pane only, never the nav), reads as one coherent index instead of N flat rows. Below ~900px
  the accordion groups stack in a plain column (no sticky, no horizontal scroll — an accordion
  has nowhere to unfold sideways in a narrow layout, same reasoning as the primary nav's
  flyout-to-inline fallback below).

### Info Tooltip
- **What it's for:** a KPI, chart, or any other compact/abstracted piece of data whose meaning
  isn't self-evident from its label alone (how it's calculated, what's included/excluded,
  what a bucket like "Sin asignar" means) — explained on demand instead of via permanent
  helper text that would clutter a dense dashboard.
- **Trigger:** a 14px circular "i" glyph (Ink Muted at rest, Azul Vibrante on hover/focus),
  placed immediately after the KPI/chart title, same line, `{spacing.xs}` gap. Never placed on
  its own row or floated away from the title it explains.
- **Behavior:** reveals on **both** hover and keyboard focus (`tabindex="0"` +
  `:focus-visible`) — a hover-only tooltip is invisible to keyboard users, which fails the
  product's WCAG AA commitment. The bubble is Ink background / Surface text, Data typography,
  `{rounded.sm}`, the Floating shadow (§4 Shadow Vocabulary — tooltips join dropdowns/popovers/
  date pickers in that list), `duration-fast` + `ease-standard` fade-and-rise-4px. Sits at
  `{zIndex.tooltip}` (500, the top of the z-index scale — a tooltip must never be occluded by
  a modal, toast, or sticky nav that happens to be open at the same time).
- **Accessibility wiring:** the trigger carries `aria-describedby` pointing at the bubble's
  `id`; the bubble carries `role="tooltip"`. Never implement this as a bare `title="…"`
  attribute (no styling control, inconsistent OS-level delay/appearance) or as `role="img"` on
  a wrapper around real content (hides the content from assistive tech).
- **Content:** one to two short sentences, plain language, states what's counted/excluded and
  the time window if one applies (e.g. "últimos 30 días", "mes actual"). Not a repeat of the
  title — it earns its place by adding the thing the title can't say in four words.

### Named Rules
**The Explain-on-Demand Rule.** A dense dashboard's KPIs and charts get their explanation via
Info Tooltip (§5), not via permanent caption text under every tile — permanent captions on
every single tile is the "identical card grids" AI-SaaS tell (§6 Don't) wearing a data-viz
costume. Reach for a permanent `chartHint`-style caption only when the context is genuinely
load-bearing for reading the chart correctly at a glance — the deeper "how is this computed"
explanation still goes in the tooltip either way.

### Primary Navigation (category rail + flyout)
For an app whose top-level nav has many categories/items (too many to list flat in a 260px
column), use a two-panel pattern instead of a single scrolling list:
- **Rail:** left sidebar, Surface background, one row per category (a `<button>`, not a link —
  categories don't navigate). Each row leads with a 16px hand-drawn glyph unique to that
  category instead of a number or bullet — `currentColor`, ~1.3px stroke, matching the Info
  Tooltip icon's convention, never a unicode/emoji stand-in. Ink-secondary text at rest,
  Surface Sunken background on hover. Azul Profundo fill + white text only on the category
  that contains the current route (see Rationed Brand Rule) — that fill persists regardless of
  what's hovered, so "where am I" never disappears just because the mouse moved. Raleway body
  typography, not Label — these are content, not micro-labels. Each row also carries a small
  right-pointing chevron at the trailing edge (same hand-drawn convention) that nudges 2px on
  hover as the only affordance beyond the flyout itself opening.
- **Flyout:** a floating panel (Floating shadow, `{rounded.md}`, `{zIndex.dropdown}`) anchored
  to the right edge of whichever category row is open — `position: absolute` so it never
  pushes the main content column, positioned per-row via CSS (`left: 100%` on the row itself,
  not computed in JS). Opens on hover **and** focus (same dual trigger as Info Tooltip) so
  keyboard users reach it — mouse close is debounced 300ms from `mouseleave` of the whole nav
  (cancelled the instant the pointer re-enters anywhere in the nav), so the gap between a row
  and its own flyout — an unavoidable side effect of anchoring via CSS instead of computing
  exact coordinates — doesn't close the panel out from under a slow diagonal mouse move; a
  real navigation click or focus leaving the nav's DOM subtree (`relatedTarget` check) closes
  immediately, no debounce. Never on blur into the flyout's own items. Items reachable today
  render as real `NavLink`s (`.navItem`/`.navItemActive`, same treatment as any other nav
  link); items planned but not built yet render as plain text plus a neutral "En desarrollo"
  Badge — same place in the tree, no click target (this is how a large roadmap stays visible
  in the IA without shipping dead links). Opens with a 200ms (`duration-standard`) fade + 4px
  slide, `ease-standard`, no reduced-motion override needed beyond disabling that one animation
  and the chevron nudge.
- **Mobile (<768px):** the flyout has nowhere to float in a single narrow column, so below
  768px it renders in-flow (`position: static`) directly under its category instead of
  overlapping — the whole sidebar stacks above the content with its own capped-height scroll.
  A tab-based detail view separately becomes a stepper/accordion rather than horizontal tabs
  below ~640px.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** keep the app canvas cool-tinted neutral (#EDEEFE family) — never the warm cream/sand
  "AI default."
- **Do** reserve Azul Vibrante and Verde Vibrante for actions, status, and identity moments —
  the Rationed Brand Rule (≤10% of any screen).
- **Do** use underline tabs for short section sets and a sticky vertical section nav once a
  detail view outgrows what a tab row can hold (see Section Navigation, §5).
- **Do** use `tabular-nums` on every numeric table column.
- **Do** give every loading/empty/error state real, deliberate content — this product handles
  sensitive data, ambiguity erodes trust.
- **Do** let list/table views and forms use the full content width, organizing form fields
  into horizontal rows grouped by named section (see Forms, §5) — never a single narrow
  vertical field stack.
- **Do** gate an existing record's fields behind one global Editar/Guardar/Cancelar control in
  the page header (see View/Edit Mode, §5) — a creation wizard is the only place fields are
  always editable, since nothing is saved there yet.
- **Do** wrap every independently-scrolling content pane in Lenis so scrolling eases
  continuously instead of stepping section by section (see the Fluid Scroll Rule, §4) — but
  leave the sidebar nav and any fixed chrome on native scroll.
- **Do** explain a non-obvious KPI or chart with an Info Tooltip next to its title (§5,
  keyboard-reachable, `role="tooltip"`) instead of permanent caption text under every tile —
  the Explain-on-Demand Rule (§5).

### Don't:
- **Don't** replicate the SAP/Oracle-2000s look: dense gray forms with no hierarchy, generic
  icon sets, unlabeled cramped tables.
- **Don't** ship generic AI-SaaS scaffolding: identical icon+heading+text card grids, gradient
  hero metric tiles, uppercase eyebrows above every section, side-stripe colored borders on
  cards/alerts.
- **Don't** let the interface feel like a playful consumer app — no bouncy/elastic motion, no
  mascot-like illustration, no gratuitous color on data-dense screens.
- **Don't** use Off-white aed (#F0ECE6) as a screen background — it's a print-collateral color.
- **Don't** add a shadow to anything that isn't floating above the page (see Floating-Only
  Rule).
- **Don't** apply gradient-text (`background-clip: text`) anywhere — the aed gradient is a
  graphic accent element (per the brand manual), never a text treatment.
- **Don't** repeat an Editar/Guardar/Cancelar control inside every tab or section of a detail
  view — one global control per page, always.
- **Don't** grow the accent-vibrant status dot into a stripe, larger chip, or full badge fill —
  it stays a 6px indicator, the one deliberate exception to badges never using the raw accent
  token (see Status Dot, §5).
